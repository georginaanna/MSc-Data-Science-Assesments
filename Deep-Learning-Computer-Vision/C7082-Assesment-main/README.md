Data: 

For the analysis, the data was not collected by myself, and instead was obtained from Kaggle, a website that contains many data sets for keen data science learners to enter competitions and practice predictive modelling and analytics (Shaikh, R, not dated).The location of the data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview
